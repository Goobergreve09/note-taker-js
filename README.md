## Description

This was my first project created using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). It was created using the **GET**, **POST**, and **DELETE** methods from the express framework. It's a simple application for creating, saving, and deleting notes. This is very handy for anyone with a busy schedule, including myself. Each note is given a unique identifier and is saved in the server as a json object. This application was created using a mixture of frontend and backend.

My main goal of this project was to further my experience in backend development as a full-stack developer whilst also creating a cool and useful note-taking application.

 From there add a title for your note, for example *'take out trash'* and then give details as necessary like *'trash must be taken out today because I will not be home tomorrow'*. clicking the **save note** button at the top right of the page will keep this note saved for you in the server. You can delete this note simply by clicking the trash icon. That's All! take and save notes very easily.
